This repository comprises of a web application designed for an intranet environment for real-time messaging. It allows the users (staff) to add other users in their list to communicate with them through text and images. The contact between a pair of users has been implemented as two unidirectional pipes, both of which are by default blocked. Once a user adds some other user, the pipe of which he is the receiver gets unblocked and he can then receive messages for the other user. A user can block incoming messages from any other user which implies that the flow of messages between to users can be unidirectional or bidirectional depending on the need or convenience of the pair of users.
